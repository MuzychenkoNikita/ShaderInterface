## Mission
ShaderInterface or SHIN is a non-commercial open-source project that is free to use and contribute to. The goal of the project is to enhance tools like ShaderToy by providing more input options and introducing new functionality, such as rendering shaders directly into files. The project is still in an early (and somewhat raw) stage, but already includes several working features.
